- 👋 Hi, I’m @Altronza otherwise known as Aeden or Buckyo. A lot of names I suppose.
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Design, Programming, and Storytelling. 
     + I cycle between being obssessed with Science or Fantasy Narratives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Game Design at the Academy of Art University for my BFA. 
     + While focusing on Programming & Perspective Art in my Spare Time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can teach me more Programming techniques.
     + But I may not be available due to school.
- 📫 How to reach me : Email: 132modingrocks@gmail.com

- 🧠 I tend to start working from a Dramatic Narrative and then build out everything else as I go.
     + I like to make Procedural or Reusable Processes in my Coding. With all the Bugs to match.
     
- With that out of the way, hello.
